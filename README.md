## Description

A Genichiro (Ashina castletop battle) focussed mod, this mod-series adds new attacks, combo-chains and reactions to Genichiro's existing moveset.<br>
The releases vary in difficulty, with the latest release (<strong>Genichiro:The Rival v3.1.4</strong>) being the most difficult and well-developed, and the first release (<strong>Genichiro:The Last Stand</strong>) being the easiest-barely any different from the base game battle.<br>
I would highly recommend installing and playing the latest release <strong>only</strong>, but you can try out the other versions if you'd like- the more initial the release, the lesser the changes.
