A Genichiro focussed mod, currently barebones-adding new combos to his regular attacks and patterns.
Every release will fix some bugs/add new moves.
Currently, the mod also adds in a changed spin combo attack for Owl(Father).<br>
Check releases for more information.
<br>
Fixed the Genichiro:Way of Tomoe animation glitch.
