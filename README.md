<br>
A Genichiro (Ashina castletop battle) focussed mod, this mod-series adds new attacks, combo-chains and reactions to Genichiro's existing moveset.<br>
The releases vary in difficulty, with the latest release(Genichiro:The Rival) being the most difficult and well-developed and the first release(Genichiro:The Last Stand) being the easiest-barely any different from the base game battle.<br>
I would highly recommend installing and playing the latest release <strong>only</strong>, but you can try out the other versions if you'd like- the more initial the release, the lesser the changes.<br>
